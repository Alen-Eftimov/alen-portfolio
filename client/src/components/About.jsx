                        Hello! I'm Alen, a Full Stack developer and a trained Electrical engineer in the field of Telecommunications with more than 10 years of professional experience in various technical fields.
                        I was constantly able to fulfil my work on time and to adhere to very high quality standards. In 2019, I decided to switch my career path to embrace programming, which always used to be my goal, 
                        by joining a full stack web development course at DCI based on the MERN Stack. I am looking forward to applying my work ethic and analytic abilities that I developed in my career in the field of web development.
                    </p>
